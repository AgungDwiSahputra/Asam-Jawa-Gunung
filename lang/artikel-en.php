    'isi7' => '<div>Agricultural Product Buyer Collectors. Before discussing about running an agricultural product collector business, let`s first discuss the meaning of collector itself.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Maybe many of us are still unfamiliar with the meaning of collectors. Especially for city people who work in the office sector.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Collecting is an economic activity carried out by a person to provide a place, collect or concentrate a product or goods.</div>
    <div>
    <div class="inner-post-ads"></div>
    </div>
    <div>For example in the world of agriculture is a place where farmers can sell their agricultural products such as markets or directly in the garden</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Running a business as a collector of agricultural products does not have to be people who work in agriculture, but those of you who have talent in buying and selling can also do it.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Here are tips for those of you who want to dive into this world:</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>First is to have a modal.</div>
    <div>All businesses must have capital in order to run. But to run this business you do not have to have a lot of capital. Start your business with a small capital, because the most important thing is that you have taken action.</div>
    <div>
    <div class="inner-post-ads-2"></div>
    </div>
    <div>Second is doing promotion.</div>
    <div>For you as a beginner in running this business, start promoting the people around you by buying their agricultural products.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>If you have started it then slowly you will be known as a collector of agricultural products.</div>
    <div>You can start at the market or in your own village.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>The third is, looking for potential buyers. What is meant by potential buyers are people who will buy the agricultural products that you have collected. Because if the buyer is a potential buyer it will affect the course of your business.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>The more potential, the bigger the result. Consider the results you will get so you don`t lose when your goods have been bought by someone else.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Fourth is to develop your sales market.&nbsp;In developing your sales market, you have to expand your network and look for potential sellers.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>If at first you only buy agricultural products from neighbors or people around you, then next you have to expand your network by looking for candidates in other areas.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Fifth, Door to door. Especially for those of you who live in plantation areas, you can buy directly from farmers. This is of course to get a cheaper price.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Some of the advantages of running this business are as follows:</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Helping Farmers In this case, a collector has provided a good place for farmers to sell their agricultural products.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>In addition, farmers will feel confident that their agricultural products will be sold, which keeps the enthusiasm of the farmers to cultivate commodities.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Your profit&nbsp;will get financial benefits, whose name is a business that is definitely looking for profit, right? One of the most promising rural businesses is being a collector. But that doesn`t mean it`s not without risk. Because all efforts will surely&nbsp; there is a risk.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>If we live in a business village, being a collector is quite tempting because we will get a lot of commodities to resell on a large scale.</div>

    'isi9' => '<p>Selling Exports of Agricultural Products. Indonesian agricultural products have a lot of demand abroad. The proof is that many agricultural products are routinely exported with a fairly large nominal, even though the conditions are in decline.</p>
    <p>The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) noted that Indonesia`s total exports of agricultural products reached US$ 423.4 million. Down 8.61% compared to the previous month. In accumulated January-May 2015, exports were US$ 2.2 billion.</p>
    <p>Indonesia is a country that has the potential to export agricultural products with quality commodities. It is proven that the majority of the Indonesian population are farmers, both on farm and off farm farmers. According to BPS data, the number of Indonesian exports in agriculture on average has increased from year to year, although it sometimes fluctuates. Several commodities in Indonesia are very much demanded by importers from foreign countries to meet their country`s needs. It is undeniable that the quality of local commodities in Indonesia is unquestionable. The following is a list of commodities that are recognized by the world and have succeeded in printing as Indonesian export commodities.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Coffee</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Indonesia is the largest coffee-producing country, as evidenced by the large number of coffee plantations in Indonesia with various characteristics that characterize the area. Coffee is a commodity that is forbidden if it can not be touched to the international market through exports. Rasa&nbsp;<a title="Indonesian coffee" href="https://www.agromaret.com/kopi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indonesian coffee</a>&nbsp; both in the tongue of the Indonesian people themselves or the tongue of the world community. One of the country`s mainstay types of coffee is Kopi Luwak. This coffee, which is processed through the assistance of the civet animal, does have a unique characteristic both in terms of taste and process. Luwak coffee is much sought after by world coffee connoisseurs, considering that civet coffee only exists in Indonesia. Based on BPS data, coffee exports in 2015 amounted to 499,612.7 tons to 22 countries in the world.</p>
    <ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Tea</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to being suitable for the tongue of the Indonesian people, requests for&nbsp;<a title="teh" href="https://www.agromaret.com/teh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teh&nbsp;< /a>the world continues to soar. According to BPS data, Indonesia`s export income data will increase in the 2000-2015 period, although in the 2013-2015 period, the income will decrease from 131,345.5 US$ to 89,630,2 US$</p>
    <ol start="3">
    <li><strong>Tobacco</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Many people think that tobacco and cigarettes are the same thing, even though they have very different meanings. Tobacco is an agricultural crop and cigarettes are factory processed products. Tobacco can be used as a cold or flu medicine and the leaves can also be made into vegetables. Indonesia is one of the largest producers of tobacco commodities, so tobacco is included in the category of exporter commodities. According to BPS data, in 2015 Indonesia succeeded in exporting 11,574.2 tons of tobacco to 16 developed countries in the world.</p>
    <ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Chocolate Seeds</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Chocolate beans or familiarly called cacao beans are one of the agricultural products in Indonesia which occupies the number three position of the largest cocoa producer in the world. Cocoa beans can be made in various variants of chocolate flavors which are very delicious and suitable to be used as a mainstay product. Unfortunately, cocoa exports are still in the form of results&nbsp;<em>on farm</em>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<em>off farm</em>. Currently, cocoa bean processing producers are increasingly being developed. Even so, the quality of off farm produce is still unable to compete with foreign processed products such as Belgium. Statistical data shows exports of cocoa beans amounted to 55,299.4 tons with an income of US$ 118,282.5. This figure should be a matter of pride and a challenge for Indonesia to develop cocoa bean processing in a form and attractiveness that is able to align with foreign products.</p>
    <ol start="5">
    <li><strong>Fruits</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Another export quality agricultural product is fruit. Indeed, technologically, Indonesia is still less competitive with technology in several developed countries. However, it is undeniable that Indonesia has added value in terms of fruit productivity considering its land and geographical area bonuses. Some of the fruits that become mainstay commodities are mangosteen, soursop, and guava. These three fruits have dominated the international market, so many farmers are competing to improve the quality of fruits in Indonesia.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Plant Distributors. In agricultural products agroforestry, trees are raised as a source of wood, pulp, or fuel. In many areas, this kind of intensive forestry is being developed as an alternative to harvesting natural forest.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">In temperate climates, the most important trees planted are pine, spruce, larch, and poplars. Depending on species and site conditions, these trees can be harvested after a growth period of only 10 to 60 years, compared to 60 to more than 100 years for natural, managed forests in the same area.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">In the tropics, fast-growing, high-yielding species of trees are grown for use locally as fuel , animal feed, wood, and pulpwood. Various tree species include pine, eucalyptus dia-oak, and tree-nut. Slowergrowing tropical hardwoods, such as teak and mahogany, are grown for their high quality wood.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Climate dominates agriculture, second only to irrigation. Plants are very susceptible to weather variations, such as late or early snow, heavy rain, or drought. Because of their ability to grow in a wide range of climates, rice, wheat and corn have become the dominant crops globally.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">These plants all need a rainy season for germination and growth, followed by a dry season to allow rot free storage . Rice is domesticated in the seasonal soils of Southeast Asia, while wheat comes from the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. Historically, wheat was planted in the fall and harvested in late spring, coinciding with the cycles of wet and dry seasons in the Mediterranean region. Corn needs the heavy summer rain provided by Mexico`s highland climate.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Another plant common in areas with less favorable climates. These include barley on semiarid lands (those with light rainfall); wheat and potatoes in cool, moist soil; rye in cold climates with a short growing season; and dry rice on hillsides and dry land.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Although food production is the main emphasis in agriculture, more and more industrial applications have evolved. Fabric fibers, such as cotton, have been the mainstay, but paper products and chemicals now come from cultivated plants.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Cultivation refers to the farming of aquatic animals and plants for use as food. Increasingly, aquaculture or fish farming is seen as an alternative to the exploitation of wild species of aquatic animals and plants.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Most freshwater aquaculture occurs in inland areas where there are many ponds and small lakes. Freshwater aquaculture is especially important in Asia, where a wide variety of fish, especially carp and tilapia, are raised in artificial ponds. In North America, the most common species of fish growing in small ponds are rainbow trout and catfish.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: .25in; background: white;"><span style="color: #404040;">Aquaculture is also becoming increasingly important along marine protected coastlines in many parts of the world. In the tropics, large areas of mangrove forest are being converted into shallow ponds for shrimp farming. In North America and Western Europe, Atlantic salmon farming became a widespread industry in the late twentieth century, using pens floating in shallow, coastal bays and occasionally in the open ocean.

    <p>Most agricultural crops are managed as annuals, meaning they are cultivated in cycles of one year or less. This is true of all grains and legumes and most vegetables.

This species is the only member of the genus Tamarindus. Some parts of the tamarind plant have been used for food and medical purposes. Tamarind fruit flesh is used as raw material for making herbal medicines, while tamarind flowers and leaves are commonly consumed as vegetables.</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;"> Tamarind seed extract contains natural polysaccharides and tannins consisting of D-galactose, D-7 glucose and D-silose which are natural flocculants. Tannins are phenolic compounds that are soluble in water and can precipitate proteins from solution. Natural coagulants, especially polysaccharides, are more environmentally friendly when compared to organic and inorganic coagulants.</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">The tamarind seeds are irregular in shape, dark brown or glossy black in color. Seeds are divided into three main parts, namely the seed coat (Spermodermis), the umbilical cord (Funiculus), and the seed core (Nukleus seminis). The seed coat consists of an outer layer, a middle layer and an inner skin layer. The core of tamarind seeds consists of an embryo (embryo) and an embryo (albumen) which is a food reserve network for the beginning of growth.</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;"> Tamarind Seeds Tamarind seeds can be used as a coagulant in the coagulation process because of the consideration of the tannin content in the seeds. Tannins are phenolic compounds that are soluble in water. With a molecular weight between 500-3000 can precipitate proteins from solution. Most tamarind seeds contain tannins, especially in the seed coat. The darker the color of the seed coat, the higher the tannin content. Tannins contained in plants are active substances that cause the coagulation process and natural polymers such as starch function as flocculants and coagulants.</p>
    <h6>Javanese Acid Content</h6>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">Compounds Contained in Tamarind Seeds Tamarind seeds contain active substances in the form of tannins, essential oils and several natural polymers such as starch, gum and albuminoids.</p> p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">A. Tannins</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">Tannins are compounds that can inhibit microbial growth by inhibiting the work of enzymes such as cellulose, pectinase, oxidative peroxide and others. The phenol present in the tannin compound is known as carbolic acid which in high concentrations can be toxic to bacteria and is usually used to kill germs.</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">B. Essential Oil</p>
    <p class="western" style="text-align: left;">Essential oil (aromatic oil) is a group of vegetable oils that are thick liquid and at room temperature will easily evaporate so that it will cause a distinctive aroma. This oil is used to reduce unpleasant odors.</p>

Indonesia is famous for its herbal medicine country due to the large number of palawija and other agricultural products that can be used as food and drinks that are healthy for the body, and one of them is a drink called "jamu".

Kunir is the Javanese term for turmeric, while asem is the Javanese term for tamarind. The two combinations of Indonesian spices will make the body feel fresh again after drinking it. You don`t have to worry, because to get this traditional drink is fairly easy. There are still many traveling herbalists or herbal medicine stalls selling Javanese tamarind turmeric herbs.</p>
    <p>However, if your concern is with the quality of the spices made, are they real or contain dyes and preservatives? You can use indigenous Indonesian products produced by PT Tamarindo Bumi Utama. One of their superior products is <strong>Asam Jawa Cap Gunung. Tamarind Cap Gunung </strong>is an original Indonesian tamarind which is processed in a modern and hygienic manner from the collection and packaging process to marketing to the hands of consumers.
